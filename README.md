### High Level Components

(INCOMPLETE)

Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app
- What this means are the entities in the ERD....list them and explain them individually...also why do they exist in the first place?
- also talk about Models and Views as part of what those Models are for...but specifically to those models. eg if you had a blog site (Post model and Comment model) Comment doesn't have its own controller but Post does

---
### Third party services

Detail any third party services that your app will use

- A gem is not one, UNLESS it connects to something external.

- DEPLOYMENT platform is also a third party service.


---
### Active Record Associations

(INCOMPLETE)

Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other

- NOT the ERD, but rather ActiveRecords associations... has_many...etc
- Could be displayed in a table..yes!...but still need to discuss the relationships and why there needs to be a relationship between those two things..

---
### Database Relations

R18	Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application

NOT the same as R17,...use ‘relational database’ language......it is a narrative discussion of the ERD.

---
### Database Schema Design

(INCOMPLETE)

R19	Provide your database schema design

- It is not talking about the schema.rb file.
- IF your ERD is complete...it will already answer this...an ERD is a visual representation of a schema.
